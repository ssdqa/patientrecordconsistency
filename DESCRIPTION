Description: The Patient Record Consistency module, part of the larger SQUBA ecosystem, tests the
    consistency of clinical data representation within a patient's record. The goal is to ensure that
    the patient's information is confirmatory and complete, such that two events that are expected to
    co-exist do both occur within the same patient (i.e. a leukemia diagnosis and chemotherapy).
