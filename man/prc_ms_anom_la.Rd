\usage{
prc_ms_anom_la(process_output, event_filter)
}
\arguments{
\item{process_output}{the output from \code{prc_process}}

\item{event_filter}{the event type of interest for the analysis; can be either
\code{a}, \code{b}, \code{both}, or \code{neither}}
}
\value{
three graphs:
\enumerate{
\item line graph that shows the smoothed proportion of patients
across time computation with the Euclidean distance associated with each line
\item line graph that shows the raw proportion of patients
across time computation with the Euclidean distance associated with each line
\item a bar graph with the Euclidean distance value for each site, with the average
proportion as the fill
